# Highway Dash

Highway Dash is an arcade-like game built using Python and the Pygame library. In Highway Dash, you take control of a taxi as it speeds down a multi-lane road. The goal is to travel as far as possible while avoiding other cars and obstacles. If you crash, you lose a life, and the game continues until all lives are lost. Your performance is measured by the score, which increases the longer you stay in the game.
